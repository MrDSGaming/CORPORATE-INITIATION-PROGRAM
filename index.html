    <p>
        <i><b>"Corporate Initiation Program"</b> or in short <b>"CIP"</b>,
            has been developed by education experts in <b>Singapore</b> to help you answer
            the questions and gain first hand industry experience & insights in order to
            take a well informed <b>career decision.<br><br></b>
            The creation of a corporation involves a legal process called incorporation
            where legal documents containing the primary purpose of the business, name
            and location, and the number of shares and types of stock issued, are drafted.<br><br>
            The process of incorporation gives the business entity a distinct feature that
            protects its owners from being personally liable in the event of a lawsuit or
            legal claim.<br>
            A corporation can be created by a single shareholder or by multiple shareholders
            who come together to pursue a common goal. A corporate can be formed as a
            for-profit or a not-for-profit entity.<br>
            For-profit entities form the majority of corporations, and they are formed to
            generate revenues and provide a return to their shareholders, according to their
            percentage of ownership in the corporation.<br>
            Not-for-profit entities operate under the category of charitable organizations,
            which are dedicated to a particular social cause such as educational, religious,
            scientific, or research purposes. Rather than distribute revenues to shareholders,
            not-for-profit organizations use their revenues to further their objectives.</i>

    <h2>WHAT IS A SMART CERTIFICATE?</h2>
    <p>
        <i>Various document types can be generated on our system to fulfil your
            varying requirements thus giving you room for personalization and
            customization.<br>
            <u>Smart certificates/badges are <b>digital credentials,</b> students earn when
                completing online courses or in-person training. They can be issued by any
                organization - schools, universities, companies, or non-profits.</u><br><br>
            Smart certificates provide a different view on education and certification.
            With smart certificates, you can empower yourself, your students or your
            employees. They make education and certification simple, straightforward and
            credible for everyone.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
        <i>Smart certificates and open badges are a new generation of technology-enabled
            credentials that provide proof of an individual's professional achievements and
            qualifications. They include key elements such as:</i><br>
        <li>Date of issue, including the exact time when the certificate was issued</li>
        <li>Details on the course, including a description and what was learned from it</li>
        <li>The name of the institution or organization issuing the certificate</li>
        <li>The name of the person being certified</li>
        <li>Institution's logo or personalized seal</li>
        <li>A precise URL where each certificate can be verified online to prove its authenticity</li>
        <li>A unique serial number for each smart certificate</li>

    </p>
    <p>
        <i>Smart certificates are paperless documents that are uniquely verifiable
            and tamper-proof because they're hosted on the blockchain. They represent
            real-world achievements, whether in education or the workforce.
            Smart certificates are digital native; they live online and are accessible
            anywhere in the world to anyone with an internet connection. This makes them
            ideal for today's global workplace, where degrees, diplomas, certifications,
            and licenses must be portable, verifiable and trustworthy across borders and
            time zones.</i>
    </p>
    <h2>Why choose the Smart certificate platform?</h2>
